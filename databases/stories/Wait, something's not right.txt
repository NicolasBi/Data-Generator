A sound wakes you up, sounded like a knock on your front door. It's way past midnight, you're lying on the sofa with the TV on static. The house is dark, the lights are off. You're all alone. You look out the window, see there's a full moon, shining its light through the glass pane.

You get up and head towards the front door. You look through the peephole. No one outside. You open the door. Find no one. You check around the porch. Still no one. Maybe kids were playing tricks on you.

Annoyed, you shut the door, turn off the TV, close the window, and head upstairs to your bedroom for the night.
