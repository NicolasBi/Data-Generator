This story does not have a twist. You won’t find out that I’m really the killer at the end.

Because I’m telling you so from the beginning. I am the killer.

I was the one who killed him.

I was the one who scouted out the old man hobbling along while out walking with my son.

I was the one who wanted to follow him down the street that day.

I was the one who had brought a pair of scissors along to do the killing.

I was the one who followed him into the alleyway, leading my six year old boy in hand.

I was the one who stabbed him thirty-six times.

I was the one who consoled my crying child.

I was the one who made him promise to lie to protect me.

Just please believe me. This story does not have a twist. I am the killer.
